# sentiment_analysis_heidivsemma

A project on sentiment analysis using text analytics in R of two feminist writers of two different eras meant for two different demographic audiences. 


Book 1 is Emma, by Jane Austen, first published in 1815, was meant for an adult and youth females of that era and the coming times. 
Book 2 is Heidi, by Johanna Spyri, a popular publication for young children.


Reasoning behind choosing these two texts : Both Jane Austen and Johanna Spyri were feminist idols but each of there work was meant for different audience. It is interesting to look at the sentiment analysis in their literature and look at differences and similarities.
